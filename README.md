SBP-UNet for Pedestrian Segmentation
This repository implements SBp-UNet (Squeeze-Bypass-UNet), a novel CNN architecture that balances accuracy and efficiency for pedestrian segmentation. SBp-UNet integrates fire units from the SqueezeNet architecture with additional bypass connections to achieve high accuracy with significantly fewer parameters.

Datasets
The model is validated on:
Occluded Human (OCHuman) dataset
Pascal VOC dataset

Requirements:
Python 3.6+
PyTorch
OpenCV
NumPy
